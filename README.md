# Easy-Mint-NFTs
Going from total noob to minting an NFT as easy as possible.

# Big Picture
To create an NFT, you first need to choose a **blockchain** and a compatible **Wallet** and **dapp**.

The Blockchain stores the transactions and data that prove who owns the NFT. Ethereum is the first and most popular blockchain that supports NFTS, but it can be slow and expensive. For this guide we will be using Tezos, which is cheap, fast, and designed well for NFT use. Other options could include Solana, Polygon, or Cardano.

Our Wallet stores your account information so that you can store and use your NFT. There are various wallets avialable; some run on your computer, some are for a phone, and some run in a web browser. For the sake of this guide, we're going to be using a web based Wallet called [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app). 

The dapp, meaning **d**istributed **app**, is the code that runs on the blockchain. Dapps include an enormous range of applications that do all sorts of things, but for now all you need to know is that they can handle the minting and transferring of our NFT. For this guide we will be using Hic et Nunc which, with the help of another dapp called Objekt, makes it easy to mint NFTs.

# Minting

## Step 1 - Creating your Wallet

- Open [https://wallet.kukai.app](https://wallet.kukai.app) on a phone or computer and select **Create New Wallet** in the upper right.
- Reveal your seed and write the whole thing down. I reccomend writing it on paper. Then hit Next and verify your seed. If you ever forget your password, your seed is the only way to recover your account so make sure to keep it somewhere safe.
- Set a password
- Download your keyfile and **Open Wallet**

To access your Kukai account, load your keystore file into Kukai and unlock it with your password. If you send your keystore file to a different phone or computer then you'll be able to access your account there too.

Now you'll be albe to see how much tez, the currency of Tezos, you have. This is often written as ꜩ. Becaue the account is new you likely have 0 ꜩ. You can also check your owned NFTs (likely also empty).

## Step 2 - Getting tez

- In the upper right, click the icon to **Copy Address**. This is the address of your account.
- If you're friends with me, send Carl a message with this address and I'll send you some tez.

## Step 3 - Minting an NFT

- On the same device as your Kukai wallet, visit https://hicetnunc.art.
- Hit **sync** in the upper right then select **Kukai Wallet**.
- Go to the browser tab with your wallet and hit **approve**.

- Now hit the menu in the upper right, then selet **OBJKT (mint)**.
- Fill in the info:

Title: The name of the NFT
Description: Your description of the NFT
Tags: words that people can search to find your NFT on Hic et Nunc
Editions: how many copies of the same NFT are in existance. I usually just do 1.
Royalties: Percent of marketplace sales go to you. I usualy set to 10%. Don't worry to much about this.
Upload OBJKT: Upload your gif, jpeg, png, svg, mp4, webm, glb, mp3, wav, flac, pdf, html, or md file you want to display.

- Hit **Preview**, the select **mint OBJKT**
- Open your Kukai tab and approve the minting
- It will take around 1 to 4 minutes for the minting to complete and appear on the blockchain
- In Kukai, go to NFTs > Hic et Nunc and view your newly minted NFT

# Transferring
You can sell your NFT on the Hic et Nunc marketplace but you don't have to. For now, the easiest way to transfer your NFT to a friend is with your Kukai wallet

- Go to Kukai > NFT > tap on your NFT
- Hit **Send**
- Enter Quantity as 1, input your friends address, hit preview, the confirm the send. *(note, it's very important that you get your friends address correct because this sending cannot be undone)*
- Your friend will get the NFT
